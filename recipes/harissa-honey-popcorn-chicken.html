    <h1>Harissa-Honey Popcorn Chicken</h1>

    <h3>Saucy and glossy with a crispy-gone-slightly-soggy bite, this glazed popcorn chicken is a great excuse to start watching sports.</h3>
    
    <p>First, the chicken is marinated overnight in a buttermilk mixture that’s supercharged with finely chopped preserved lemon. Then it’s dredged in a mixture of rice flour and cornstarch, which results in a shatteringly crisp exterior that stays audibly crunchy for hours. You could substitute all-purpose flour for rice flour if needed, but it won’t be as crunchy—or gluten-free. Finally, the chicken is tossed in a sweet, spicy, and sticky harissa-honey sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h4>Chicken</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 preserved lemon</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>8 large skinless, <em>B O N E L E S S</em> chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1.5 cups rice flour</li>
        <li>Vegtable oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Sauce</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>0.5 cup butter</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp. honey</li>
        <li>6 Tbsp. Harissa paste</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp. salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <h4>Chicken</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place preserved lemon, seeds removed, on a cutting board and finely chop. Using the back of your knife, mash into a coarse paste and transfer to a large bowl. Add 1 large egg, 4 garlic cloves, finely grated, zest of 1 lemon, 1 cup buttermilk, 0.25 cup cornstarch, and 1 tsp. salt to bowl and whisk to combine. Add chicken thighs, cut into 1" pieces. Mix well to make sure each piece is coated in marinade; cover and chill at least 4 hours and up to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Whisk 1.5 cups rice flour, remaining 0.75 cup cornstarch, and remaining 0.5 tsp. salt in a large shallow dish to combine. Remove one third of chicken from bowl, letting some of the marinade drip back into bowl, and arrange in a single layer on rice flour mixture. Gently toss chicken to coat, pressing down into mixture and turning to make sure every nook and cranny is covered. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining chicken in 2 batches.</li>
        <li>Pour vegetable oil into a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot to come 2" up the sides. Heat oil over medium-high until it registers 350°F. Working in 3–4 batches, fry chicken, turning occasionally, until cooked through and golden brown, 7–10 minutes. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and let drain.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>While the chicken is frying, heat 0.5 cup butter and 3 Tbsp.  honey in a small saucepan over medium until butter is melted.</li>
        <li>Scrape honey butter into a large bowl, add 6 Tbsp. harissa paste, 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, and 0.5 tsp. salt, and whisk until smooth and emulsified. Taste sauce and season with more salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Place fried chicken in sauce and toss until every piece is well coated.</li>

    </ol>
